# Open Search
 	 
## Introduction 

## Description & Mission Statement
 	 
Open Search is an open source web application geared toward simplifying, 
streamlining and customizing our user's web browsing needs. We believe in 
cutting out search engine middle-men and their targeted advertising from the 
online user's experience. Using popular sites' API's we have created a way to 
search specific sites such as Reddit, IMDb, Twitter, and Wikipedia from one 
location. Our simple but effective UI allows people of all computer literacy to 
get to the results they are looking for with little to no difficulty.
 	 
## About the Open Search Foundational Team
 	 
We are a group of five students from Loyola University Chicago taking an Open 
Source Computing course. Throughout the semester we have learned about how to 
create a successful and ethical open source project. The team is composed of 
students of different majors, skill levels, interests and ages; we hope as our 
project grows we continue to have such a diverse and passionate group. Open 
Search was drafted up in February 2018 and uses the Mozilla public license.
